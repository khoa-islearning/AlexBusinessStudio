# AlexBusinessStudio

Alex is a freelance photographer who wants to open up her own business. She has a huge set of photos in her Google Photos library and wants a system that will allow her to track all her photos (including adding and deleting photos) and manage the sales of them. Upon researching her options, she finds that she will need to opt for pricing plans on various e-commerce websites. She has a hard time figuring out which e-commerce platform to use, which plan she should take and the tools she will need. Some websites offer extra storage while also limiting her ability to store pictures to only being put for listing. Others offer better sales management tools but charge a hefty commission, but the rest are just out-right confusing. Alex just wants the necessary features for her business, no gimmicks.

One day, while explaining her dilemma to her friend, she is recommended to contact Creative Business Studio - ‘ who solve all your business needs’. Upon contacting and communicating the necessary finances and feature requirements, she strikes an amazing deal! Creative Business Studio is given a budget of $2000 to set up a custom ecommerce platform for Alex, as well implement features that allow Alex to manage her storage and sales.
